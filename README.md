# Data-Science-1st-Project - CODERS OF DELHI

## 📌 Description

This is my first data science project, titled **CODERS OF DELHI**.  
I built this project using **pure Python** — without using any data cleaning or preprocessing libraries. The only module used is Python’s built-in `json` module to load and work with the data.

The focus was on writing **clean, systematic, and ethical production-level code**. The project involves:

- Loading and cleaning raw JSON data
- Preprocessing data manually
- Building 2 interesting systems:
  - **Friend Recommendation System** (People You May Know)
  - **Page Suggestion System** (Pages You Might Like)

## 🚀 Features

- Fully Python-based (no Pandas, NumPy, etc.)
- Simple logic with readable structure
- Friend and page recommendation using mutual connections

## 📂 Project Structure

- `project.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook with all logic
- `data/` – Folder containing the input JSON data files

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

You can run this project using **Jupyter Notebook**. Here’s how:

### 🔧 Step 1: Install Jupyter Notebook

If not already installed, run this in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install notebook
